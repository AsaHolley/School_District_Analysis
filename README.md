# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis ##

This project is based around the testing (math and reading) performance of high school students in a particular school district that looked into a number of factors that could affect the overall passing rate (>=70%) of each individual school. Factors included, size of the school, budget per student, grade level, and type of school. This project also required the removal and re-evaluation of the school district data after it was discovered that the 9th grade class at one of the high schools (Thomas High) had wide spread academic dishonestly. 

**This project used the following resources:** Pythonic code, Jupyter notebook, csv based resources, and the Pandas software library

**Raw code can be found here:** [Code in Juypter Notebook](https://github.com/AsaHolley/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Challenge/PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb)


## Results ##
  * How is the district summary affected?
  
  * How is the school summary affected?
  
  * How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
  
  * How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
      * Math and reading scores by grade
      
      * Scores by school spending
      
      * Scores by school size
      
      * Scores by school type
